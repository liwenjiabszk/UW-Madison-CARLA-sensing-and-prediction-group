# UW-Madison-CARLA-sensing-and-prediction-group
## About this project
This project uses CARLA to implement the simulation of autonous vehicles in traffic systems. The codes are three tasks of this project of control group and finished by me.

This project is advised by Professor Bin Ran, at University of Wisconsin-Madison, and contributed by Wenjia Li in CARLA project.

## Code
### Task 1: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network code: Task 1.ipynb

This task is aimed to building and training a neural network to classify the images and contribute as a part of the project.

### Task 4: Vehicle Data Extraction and Storage code: ls4

This task is aimed to extract and store the camera data and extract and store the information (location/speed/acceleration) of all the vehicles.
The details could find in readme file in ls4 folder.

### Contol goup task: Longitudinal and Lateral Control of vehicles code: controller2d.py

This task is aimed to control the throttle, brake, and steer of the vehicle to make the vehicle drive along a list of
waypoints. The code implement the longitudinal control and lateral control. For the longitudinal control of a vehicle, a PID controller is deployed. For lateral control, the Stanley controller is implemented.
